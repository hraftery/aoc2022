using SparseArrays

# The following definitions work well if you create your grid with something like:
#
#    ys = Vector{Int}(); xs = Vector{Int}(); cs = Vector{Cell}();
#    push!(ys, 1); push!(xs, 1); push!(cs, tile);
#    ...
#    push!(ys, 2); push!(xs, 3); push!(cs, wall);
#    board = sparse(ys, xs, cs)
#

# Make sure zero is empty to suit SparseArray which only stores non-zeros.
@enum Cell cEmpty cRight cDown cLeft cUp
const CellStr  = ".>v<^"
CellChar(cell) = CellStr[index(cell)]
CharCell(char) = Cell(findfirst(char, CellStr)-1)

# These three overrides are just to keep SparseArray happy. 
Base.zero(::Type{Cell}) = empty # Not sure why these need to be explicit.
Base.zero(::Cell) = empty       # Feel like I'm doing something wrong...

        #invoke(show, Tuple{IO, MIME"text/plain", supertype(Cell)}, io, m, c)
    end

# necessary to get correct alignment. Makes no sense at all...

# to make *something* worse by trying to improve on it. So keep this standalone.
